TrackShip: A Practice Web Project

👋 Hello there! Welcome to TrackShip, a personal project I've built to explore and learn web development on my own.

📦 What is TrackShip?

TrackShip is a demo web page designed to simulate a parcel tracking platform. Its main goal is to allow users to enter a tracking number and view its delivery status (in this practice version, it displays a simulated result).

✨ Why Did I Build This Project?

As a beginner web developer (or an enthusiastic self-learner!), I created this project to:

Learn and practice HTML & CSS for structuring and styling web pages.

Build a tangible project from scratch to grasp the overall web development process.

🛠️ Technologies Used

HTML: For the core structure of the web page.

CSS: For styling, layout, and ensuring responsiveness.

🙏 Need Feedback! (Especially for a Beginner!)

If you have any advice, suggestions, or spot areas where the code could be improved (following best practices!), please feel free to share. Any feedback is incredibly valuable for a beginner like me!

Thanks for checking out my TrackShip project!
